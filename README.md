Sherlock is an output range analysis tool for deep neural networks.
The current version can handle only feedforward neural networks, with ReLU activation units. 

The only library that is needed is the MILP solver Gurobi. It's free for academic purposes and 
can be downloaded from here : http://www.gurobi.com/resources/getting-started/mip-basics
